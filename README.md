Skore is an open-source, cross-platform game engine for 2D and 3D game development. Built with modern C++20, it provides developers with a clean, extensible foundation for creating games across multiple platforms.

**üéÆ Complete 2D and 3D game development** - unified interface for all your game creation needs  
**‚ö° Performance-focused** - lightweight architecture with efficient rendering pipeline  
**üîß Extensible by design** - modular system allowing easy customization and plugin development  
**üåê Cross-platform** - deploy to Windows, Linux, macOS and more platforms  
**üõ†Ô∏è Integrated tooling** - comprehensive editor and development environment  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Status**: Skore is currently in active development and should be considered alpha software. The API may change between versions. Not recommended for production use at this time.
